# Overloaf - Review

Overleaf is an online editor used for text files. It is based on LATEX, which is a document prepration system. It has free and paid features with montly and annual fees. It has two panes, one on left and the other on right. The left one is know as 'editor' where simple syntax is written and the one on right side is known as PDF. The overleaf file can be shared among collaborators, who can work at the same file at a time. The changes made in the file can be tracked. The tracking includes the time of edit, the changes made and the name of person who commited changes. The layouts can be changed, where one can hide or unhide the editor and PDF pane or even view PDF pane in another tab. The output or the PDF can be generated just by a click. 

Complex functions can be written in this editor. One can write the syntax for a symbol, instread of searching the symbols as in case of MS Word. Each equation is assigned an equation number which makes it easy to use it in engineering while dealing with the equations. Subscripts, superscript, intergration limits, summation, matrices  can easily be inserted in this. Greek letters can also be added easily just by adding "\" before the name of greek letter's name. Live chat can be done between the collabrators within overleaf.
